# CloudComp – RSO Project

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the course **Računalniške storitve v oblaku (RSO)**.  
The main goal of the project is to design and implement a **cloud-native microservices-based application**, following modern software engineering and cloud computing principles.

The application is composed of multiple independent microservices that communicate via REST APIs and are designed to be deployed in a Kubernetes environment.
